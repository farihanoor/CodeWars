# A student was working on a function and made some syntax mistakes while coding. 
# Help them find their mistakes and fix them.

"""
Intially:
def main [verb, noun]
return verb + noun
"""

# This function has three problems: square brackets instead of parenthesis,
# a colon after the parenthesis and the return command inside the
# function is not indented.
    
# Corrected version:

def main(verb, noun):
    return verb + noun
